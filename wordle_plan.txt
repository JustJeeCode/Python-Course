Set up a board 6 x 5 x
The player has 6 guesses in total x
Generate a random word with 2 random numbers x
Player enters a guess x
	- Check if the word is correct x
		- Turn the current row green and tell the user how many guesses they got the word in x
	- Check if the guess has any correct letters in the word x
		- Check if those letters are in the correct spot x
		- Check if those letters are in the wrong spot x
	Prompt user again x

Bugs:
	- IF there is one letter in a word and a user enters a guess with two of those letters it will give the user a yellow box
		- For letter in guess, check if that letter is not correct
			- If it isn't correct we add that letter to a list of incorrect letters
				- We check if there are double letters in the list
					- If that word doesn't have double letters we remove one
